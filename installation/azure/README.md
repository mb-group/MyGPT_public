# Installation on Azure VM

## Requirements
For this installation, we recommand to host User interface (UI), Backend server and Ollama (LLM server) on 3 seperate VMs. The Ollama VM should have a GPU with CUDA installed on the server/VM.

For the demo purpose, we have hosted MyGPT on following Azure VMs. You can use the same configuration or modify it as per your requirements.:

| MyGPT Component | Azure resource name | vRAM | vCPU | Disk Space | OS | Additional Hardware/ Software |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend (UI) server | Premium_v3_P1V3  | 8GB | 2 | 250GB | Windows | Node 14 LTS |
| Backend server | Standard_E4ads_v5 | 32GB | 4 | 150GB | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Ollama (LLM server) | Standard_NC8as_T4_v3 | 32GB | 8 | 56GB | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | NVIDIA GPU - Tesla  T4 |

## Installation

### Frontend (UI) server

1. Build the frontend on your local machine
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/stjude-c3d/MyGPT.git
	cd MyGPT/frontend
	npm install
	npm run build
	```

2. Copy the build files to the server
	Create an azure website using the official documentation: [Create an Azure Web App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?tabs=linux&pivots=development-environment-azure-portal)

	And copy the build files from your local machine to the Azure Web App root folder - `site/wwwroot`.

3. Access the UI on the browser
	```
	http://<vm-ip/vm-url>/
	```

### Backend server

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

	Check if you have `docker` installed on your system by running following command.

	```bash
	docker --version
	```

	If you get an error that `docker not found`,   Go to the official Docker installation page for Linux and install the appropriate Docker on your system: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

2. Clone the backend repository
	If you have zip file with MyGPT installation instructions, you can unzip it and copy it on your desktop or your desired location. You can skip remaining instructions from below and go to Step 2.

	Or you can get installation instructions by running following command from Terminal. It will create `MyGPT` folder on your Desktop or desired folder. To get this from GitHub, we will need `GitHub username` and `GitHub access token` as the GitHub repo is private. When you run the following command, it will ask for this credentials.

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/stjude-c3d/MyGPT.git
	```

3. Edit the `.env` file
	Edit the `.env` file in the `backend` folder and set the following
	
	```bash
	cd MyGPT/backend
	vi env_example
	```
	```
	SECRET_KEY = 'add django key'
	ZOTERO_API_KEY = 'Add zotero key here'
	DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD = 'add your django superuser password'
	HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = 'add your hugging face api key'
	OLLAMA_SERVER = 'add your ollama server URL' 
	```

	Add necessary keys values in the `env_example` file and save it.
	The docker compose will copy and rename this file to `.env` file and save it in the backend folder.

4. Edit the `settings.py` file in Django app
	Edit the `settings.py` file in the `backend` folder and change the following fields.

	* CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS (line 37): `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ['https://<frontend-url>']`
	* CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS (line 41): `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://<backend-url>']`

5. Build the backend server
	To build the backend server, go to the backend folder and run the following command.

	```bash
	cd MyGPT
	docker-compose build backend
	```

6. Edit nginx configuration
	Edit the `nginx.conf` file in the `nginx` folder and change `dafault.conf` file for following fields.

	* server_name (line 9): `server_name <server-url>;`
	* return 301 (line 23): `return 301 `<server-utl>$request_uri;`
	* server_name (line 44): `server_name <server-url>;`
	* ssl_certificate (line 46): `ssl_certificate <path-to-.pem-file>;`
	* ssl_certificate_key (line 47): `ssl_certificate_key <path-to-.key-file>;`

7. Build nginx server
	To build the nginx server, go to the backend folder and run the following command.

	```bash
	cd MyGPT
	docker-compose build nginx
	```

8. Run the backend server
	To run the backend server, go to the backend folder and run the following command.

	```
	cd MyGPT
	docker-compose up -d db
	docker-compose up -d backend
	docker-compose up -d nginx
	```

	You can access the backend server on the browser using the following URL.

	```
	http://<server-url>
	```


### Ollama (LLM server)

To install Ollama on the server, follow the instructions in the [Ollama installation guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md).

We also recommand to change envrironment variables in the `ollama` folder and set the following by following guide from Ollama

[How do I configure Ollama server?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md)

We also securely hosted Ollama server using Nginx. You can follow the instructions in the [Nginx configuration guide for Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-use-ollama-with-a-proxy-server)
