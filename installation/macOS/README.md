# Installation on Mac OS

## Requirements

To Run the MyGPT pipeline, we will need the following minimum specifications for your system:

*   8 CPUs
*   8 GB Memory (16 GB or more for better response time)
*   10 GB hard-drive storage

We will also need several tools to run the pipeline:

*   Brew
*   Git
*   Docker
*   Ollama

## Requirements installation

We will install these required tools in the following steps:

1. **Brew installation**

	Check if you have `brew` installed on your system by running following command.

	```
	brew --version
	```

	If you get error that `brew not found`, you can install brew by folliwng command from the new terminal window (similar to Jupyter installation but open new tab for terminal without closing existing window that's running Jupyter). For more details about brew check this [page](https://brew.sh/)

	```
	/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
	```

2.  **Brew packages installation**

	We will install Brew packages by running following commands:

	```
	brew install git
	```

3. **Docker installation**

	To run MyGPT with CPUs-only, the entire pipeline will run as a single unit from Docker.
	Check if you have `docker` installed on your system by running following command.

	```
	docker --version
	```

	If you get an error that `docker not found`, go to the official Docker installation page for Mac and install the appropriate Docker on your system: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

	You can change Docker setting to match requirements for MyGPT:

4. **Ollama installation**

	Finally, download and install Ollama by following instructions from this offical [Ollama site](https://ollama.ai/)

	You can check if Ollama is running by visiting http://localhost:11434/ in your default browser.

	Once you confirm Ollama is running, you have to pull Lllama2 model by running following command:

	```
	ollama pull llama2
	```

## MyGPT installation

1. **Get MyGPT source code**

	If you have zip file with MyGPT source code, you can unzip it and copy it on your desktop or your desired location. You can skip remaining instructions from below and go to Step 2.

	If you want to get source code from GitHub we will first get MyGPT source code by running following command. It will create `MyGPT` folder on your Desktop. To get the source code from GitHub, we will need `GitHub username` and `GitHub access token` as the GitHub repo is private. When you run the following command, it will ask for this credentials.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/mb-group/MyGPT_public.git
	```

	<ins>Note:</ins> If you don't have GitHub access token, you can genearte classic token using this guideline: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic

2. login to GitHub Docker registry

	As the GitHub repository is private rightnow, we have to login to GitHub Docker registry to use the prebuilt images. To login to GitHub Docker registry, run following command. It will ask for your GitHub username and password. 
	
	<ins> Caution:</ins> the password is your access token (same token you used in step 1), not your github password you use to login in github account.

	```
	docker login ghcr.io
	```

3. **Run docker containers**

	We will run following script to run docker containers:

	```
	cd MyGPT_public/installation/macOS
	bash run_docker.sh
	```

	This script should take around 5-10 minutes to run.
	Once the script finish running, open following pages in your default browser. 
	You can see status of different components of MyGPT pipeline on these pages.

## MyGPT pipeline usage

### **Upload publications**

* You can upload documents or publications as PDF file by going to the settings, and selecting first tab: "Publication libraries" and selecting "Upload documents" menu as screeshot below.

* start by giving your library a "Library Name" and start uploading documents.

* You can upload upto 40 PDFs at a time. You can upload multiple times to same library. It will take some time to process the documents and once it's done, you can see your new library in the list with success message.

### **Add Zotero library**

* You can add Zotero library by going to the settings, and selecting first tab: "Publication libraries" and selecting "Add Zotero library" menu as screeshot below.

* You must provide Zotero AI key, Zotero Group ID/User ID, and Zotero Collection ID to add Zotero library.

* If you need help getting any of these, you can click on the help button next to the input field or check section after screenshot.

* <ins>Zotero API key:</ins> You can generate an API key in your profile settings https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys

* <ins>Zotero User ID:</ins> You can get it from Zotero prfile page by visiting https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys. It's 6-7 digit number.

* <ins>Zotero Group ID:</ins> You can get it from URL of the group, for example, here is URL for BABU group and group ID is `4982570`: 
https://www.zotero.org/groups/4982570/babu_group/

* <ins>Zotero Collection ID:</ins> You can get it from URL of the collection, for example, here is URL for BABU group and collection ID is `YTPMLXYY`:
https://www.zotero.org/groups/4982570/babu_group/collections/YTPMLXYY
